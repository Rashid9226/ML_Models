# 🌟 ML Algorithm Intuition with Streamlit

This repository contains three interactive Streamlit apps designed to simplify and demonstrate the intuition behind popular machine learning algorithms. These apps are perfect for anyone looking to build a strong foundational understanding of how these models make decisions — not just code, but *concepts made visual*.

## 📘 Included Projects

### 1. 🌳 **Decision Tree Classifier - Intuition**

A Decision Tree is a flowchart-like structure where internal nodes represent feature-based decisions, branches represent the outcome of those decisions, and leaf nodes represent the final prediction.

This app walks you through:
- How a dataset is split at each node based on Gini Impurity or Entropy.
- Visual decision boundaries as the tree learns from the data.
- Effects of tree depth and overfitting on model performance.

🔎 Great for understanding:
- Feature selection
- Information gain
- Tree pruning

### 2. 📍 **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) - Intuition**

KNN is a simple, non-parametric algorithm that classifies a new point based on the majority class among its *K* closest neighbors in the feature space.

This app helps you explore:
- How changing the value of K affects predictions.
- Influence of distance metrics (like Euclidean distance).
- Decision boundaries formed by KNN for different K values.

🔎 Great for understanding:
- Lazy learning
- The importance of feature scaling
- Bias-variance trade-off in KNN

### 3. 🌲 **Random Forest vs Decision Tree - Intuition**

While Decision Trees are intuitive and powerful, they can overfit easily. Random Forest combats this by building multiple decision trees on different data subsets and combining their results for a more robust prediction.

This app compares:
- A single Decision Tree's decision boundary vs. a Random Forest's smoothed boundary.
- How ensemble learning reduces overfitting and improves generalization.
- The randomness introduced through bootstrapping and feature bagging.

🔎 Great for understanding:
- Ensemble learning
- Bias-variance trade-off
- The benefit of multiple weak learners forming a strong model
